Setup Instructions:

1. Create New 3D Unity Project

2. Import Scripts:
   - Copy entire Scripts folder to Assets/Scripts

3. Create Scene Objects:
   - Plane (ground): GameObject -> 3D Object -> Plane
   - Player: GameObject -> 3D Object -> Capsule
     * Add component: Player
     * Set values in inspector (health, speed, etc.)
   - Enemies: GameObject -> 3D Object -> Cube (create multiple)
     * Add component: Enemy to each
     * Set values in inspector
   - GameManager: GameObject -> Create Empty
     * Add component: GameManager

4. Configure GameManager:
   - Drag Player object to Player field
   - Set Enemies array size

- Adjust enemy speeds and ranges for different difficulties
- Add materials/colors to distinguish player from enemies
