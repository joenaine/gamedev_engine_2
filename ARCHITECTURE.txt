Project Architecture

1. Character Data System:
   - CharacterData: Encapsulates all character stats
   - Properties with get-only accessors for read-only access
   - Modifications only through specific methods (TakeDamage, Heal)

2. Input System:
   - IInputHandler: Interface for all input handling
   - PlayerInputHandler: Reads keyboard input for player
   - NPCInputHandler: Provides AI-driven input for enemies
   - Both implement same interface for consistent behavior

3. Character System:
   - Character: Abstract base class for all characters
   - Player: Concrete implementation for player character
   - Enemy: Concrete implementation for AI-controlled enemies
   - All initialization passes full Character reference (not just CharacterData)

4. AI State Machine:
   - AIStateMachine: Manages state transitions
   - AIState: Abstract base for all states
   - IdleState: Enemy waits and detects player
   - ChaseState: Enemy pursues player
   - AttackState: Enemy attacks player at close range

5. State Transitions:
   - Idle -> Chase: Player detected within detection range
   - Chase -> Attack: Player within attack range
   - Attack -> Chase: Player moves out of attack range (but still in detection range)
   - Attack -> Idle: Player moves out of detection range entirely
   - Chase -> Idle: Player moves out of detection range

Key Design Decisions:
- CharacterData is read-only from outside to prevent direct modification
- All classes receive Character reference for better access to methods/transforms
- Input interface allows same movement/action code for player and NPCs
- State machine keeps AI behavior organized and maintainable
- Distance-based transitions provide realistic enemy behavior
